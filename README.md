# Newspaper-imperium.py | The program that will finally kill Tegrum*
Just a program, who generates newspaper by using the template and deepseek. 
Without images currently. But i promise, i will add it.

| INSTALATION |

Download the zip. Unpack it. Open the command panel (WIN+R and enter cmd). Use "pip install "path/to/requirements.txt".
(If it write that he don't know who pip is, just write py -m pip install "path/to/requirements.txt")

| LAUNCHING |

In the same folder, where template (economic.png) is, by your IDE open script (.py) and configure it.
Automatically it will write about non-real cameras IS100 on russian. If you want change it, you can wirte a template again
(For english language, i think it will automatically write in russian because of template) and write your topic.
For it just find (by Ctrl+F) "TOPIC", you will sent to comment and function "send".

After this barbarian configuration, you can launch it. It will show your paper. Also it saves this paper in that folder,
and call him "example.png".
